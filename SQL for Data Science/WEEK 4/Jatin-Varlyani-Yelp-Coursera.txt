Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;


i. Attribute table = 1000
ii. Business table =1000	 
iii. Category table = 1000
iv. Checkin table = 1000
v. elite_years table = 1000
vi. friend table =  1000
vii. hours table = 1000
viii. photo table = 1000 
ix. review table = 1000 
x. tip table =  1000
xi. user table = 1000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
	FROM table

i.Business = id: 10000
ii. Hours = business_id: 1562
iii.Category = business_id: 2643
iv.Attribute = business_id: 1115
v. Review = id:10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
vi.Checkin = business_id: 493
vii.Photo = id: 10000, business_id: 6493
viii.Tip = user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
ix.User = id: 10000
x. Friend = user_id: 11
xi.Elite_years = user_id: 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM user
		WHERE id IS NULL OR 
		  name IS NULL OR 
		  review_count IS NULL OR 
		  yelping_since IS NULL OR
		  useful IS NULL OR 
		  funny IS NULL OR 
		  cool IS NULL OR 
		  fans IS NULL OR 
		  average_stars IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_hot IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_more IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_profile IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_cute IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_list IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_note IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_plain IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_cool IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_funny IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_writer IS NULL OR 
		  compliment_photos IS NULL 

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1 		max: 5		avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000		avg: 24.2995

		   name,
		   review_count
	FROM user
	ORDER BY review_count DESC

	+------------------------+--------+--------------+


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Yes, but also the amount of time that they have been yelping. 
	The longer they have been yelping and the more reviews they give has a higher fan count.

	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

		SELECT id,
			   name,
			   review_count,
			   fans,
			   yelping_since
		FROM user
		ORDER BY fans DESC
		
		+------------------------+-----------+--------------+------+---------------------+

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	i.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

		The 4-5 star group seems to have shorter hours then the 2-3 star group.
		Please note the query returned only three businesses so not a great 
		sample size.

	ii.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	
		Yes and no, one of the 4-5 star group has a lot more reviews but then the other
		4-5 star group has close to the same number of reviews as the 2-3 star group
	
	iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two
		groups? Explain.

		No, every business is in a different zip-code.

SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT B.name,
   	B.review_count,
   	H.hours,
   	postal_code,
   	CASE
		  WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
		  WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
		  WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
		  WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
		  WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
		  WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
		  WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
	END AS days,
   	CASE
	  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
	  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
   	END AS star_rating
	
	FROM business B INNER JOIN hours H
	ON B.id = H.business_id
	INNER JOIN category C
	ON C.business_id = B.id
	
	WHERE (B.city == 'Las Vegas' AND C.category LIKE 'shopping')
	AND (B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 OR B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
	GROUP BY stars, days
	ORDER BY days, star_rating ASC
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. 	Difference 1:
	
	The businesses that are open tend to have more reviews than ones that
	are closed on average.
	
		Open:   AVG(review_count) = 31.757
		Closed: AVG(review_count) = 23.198


ii.	Difference 2:

	The average star rating is higher for businesses that are open than
	businesses that are closed.

		Open:   AVG(stars) = 3.679
		Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.520
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
		   AVG(review_count),
		   SUM(review_count),
		   AVG(stars),
		   is_open
	FROM business
	GROUP BY is_open
